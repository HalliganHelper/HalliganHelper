# HalliganHelper

Welcome! HalliganHelper is a system for managing Teacher's Assistants and the
students who need them. It offers real-time queuing so that both students and
TAs can know when they'll be helped. 

It's written in [python][python], [django][django], and [backbone][backbone].

## Organization Rules

We have exactly 2:

1. Don't be rude. This project is meant to be friendly to beginners and
experienced developers alike. We're all here to learn!

2. If you find a security bug, please email 
support@halliganhelper.com immediately, and _don't_ open a github issue. We'll
do our best to patch it as soon as possible.

## Reporting Bugs

*Most Importantly* if you find a security bug, please email 
support@halliganhelper.com immediately, and _don't_ open a github issue. We'll
do our best to patch it as soon as possible.

Otherwise, file an issue on the [Github Issue Tracker][issues]. Please leave
the labeling to us.


## Contributing

_All PRs require tests before they will be merged_.

Fork the repository and follow the setup instructions below. If they don't work
for you, please quietly offer up your offering of chosen swear words to the
devops deities and file a ticket. We'll prioritize these tickets, because if 
people can't help out than what's the point?

After you've set up your development environment, check the 
[Github Issue Tracker][issues]. If you're interested in working on a ticket,
and nobody else has claimed it, comment there and let everyone know you're 
going to take it on. If you're interested in something but don't see a ticket
for it, search for any tickets that may have been closed as "WontFix" or 
similar. Assuming your ticket isn't found there, file a new one. Then start
coding and open a PR. We'll review your code, chat about other implications,
and offer constructive criticism. If a reviewer offers criticism that you feel
is something other than constructive, feel free to call them out.


### Setup

1. Install Vagrant
2. Install virtualbox
3. Clone this repo
4. run ```vagrant up```
6. There's one last setup piece that I didn't automate:
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   # In the ssh shell:
   mkdir -p ~/HH/node_modules
   mkdir -p ~/vagrant_node_modules
   sudo mount --bind ~/vagrant_node_modules ~/HH/node_modules
   ```
5. Now, whenever you want to work: In two separate shells, run ```vagrant ssh```.
7. In one of the ssh sessions, run:
   ```bash
   workon hh
   npm install
   npm run webpack-watch
   ```

8. In the other ssh session, run:
  ```bash 
  workon hh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ./manage.py migrate # There might be an issue here about there not being a row with administrator_id=1. If so, create a superuser and migrate again.
  ./manage.py createsuperuser
  ./run.sh
  ```

You can write code on your local machine and the VM will automatically pick it up and refresh. You can access the site at `http://localhost:8000`.
